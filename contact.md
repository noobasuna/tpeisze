## Check us out in Instagram reels! 
We played and coded DJI drones to recognize our faces and hand gestures with machine-learning algorithms. 
In our lab, we have 20+ DJI Tello drones, a DJI FPV 4K Camera drone (with VR Goggles and hand gear) and etc.
Please contact us if you are also interested in human-drone interaction, we might have some fun workshops together. 

Also, thanks to Monash for supporting all of my conference expenses throughout my PhD studies in Korea, India and Taiwan!! Million thanks!
