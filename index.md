## About Me

I am a PhD student at Monash University Malaysia, supervised by Professor Raphael Phan, Dr Sailaja Rajanala and Dr Ong Huey Fang. I graduated from Xidian University in 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering. I interned at Huawei and Nokia for industry experience during my undergraduate period. Malaysian born and raised. Grew up in Klang (aka Bak Kut Teh lover). IC says Bantingâ€”no complaints, both got good vibes.
