## Check us out in Instagram reels! 
We played and coded DJI drones to recognize our faces and hand gestures with machine-learning algorithms. 
In our lab, we have 20+ DJI Tello drones, a DJI FPV 4K Camera drone (with VR Goggles and hand gear) and etc.
Please contact us if you are also interested in human-drone interaction, we might have some fun workshops together.
